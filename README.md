PREDICTION OF CUSTOMER SUBSCRIPTION TRENDS FOR AN ONLINE PLATFORM USING MARKOV CHAIN ANALYSIS.

Markov chain analysis is a mathematical framework that models sequences of events where the probability of the next event depends only on the current state, not the past, a property known as the "memoryless" or "Markov" property. 

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer subscription behavior on an online OTT platform using Markov Chain Analysis. By modeling customer transitions between different subscription states, we can predict future subscription trends and customer retention patterns.

Objective
* To predict customer subscription trends for an OTT platform.
* To identify the probabilities of customers subscribing, renewing, or churning.
* To provide insights that help in customer retention strategies.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of customer subscription records with variables such as:

* Customer ID – Unique identifier for each customer
* Subscription Status – Active, cancelled, or idle
* Renewal Indicator – Whether the customer renewed the subscription
* Frequency Table:  It is a table to just check the transition of a customer from one state to another state
* Transition Probability Matrix: It's just a probability percent of the stage change of a customer
* EX:- If a person is in an idle state, there is a 17% chance that he might cancel his subscription over a period
* Initial Vector: The initial vector is the active, cancelled, idle state expected values of a day 1
* Future Expected percentage trend: Future prediction table about the status percentage on different days by taking the initial assumption as the initial vector


Transition matrix:-
Predict the future states of customers based on past behavior.

Analysis & Insights
* Identify customer groups likely to churn.
* Provide strategies for customer retention.

Technologies Used
* Microsoft Excel

Expected Outcomes
* A transition matrix showing how customers move between different subscription states.
* Prediction of customer churn rates and renewal probabilities.
* Insights for marketing and retention strategies.
